    <h1 id="name">R3PI is closing down!</h1>

    <p>
        Well, it's been fun but <a href="https://r3pi.io">R3PI</a> will be closing down over the next 6 months (until February 2020), with most of us
        moving on before the end of 2019.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        R3PI is/was a part of the Solera group of companies. Senior leadership of Solera changed in early 2019 and
        with new corporate direction, innovation-focused companies such as R3PI have gotten the chopping block.
